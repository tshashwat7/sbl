                          StemBridge Labs presents Summer camp and Winter Camp for childrenâ€™s between 8 to 16 yrs. old.These camps are specially designed with motivation to inculcate project based learning practice in NextGen students. 
                          
                          STEM-related activities are extremely intriguing and the most popular addition to summer or winter camps. The activities not only inculcate practical learning but also foster critical thinking among students through real-world based projects. The alternative ways to learn are fun and knowledgeable at the same time. 
                        </p><p> Our camps provide a more intricate, hands-on approach to learn STEM and take part in innovation which the world needs. Group sizes are smaller than a big classroom, each and every camper receives the required attention. StemBridge Labs provides the required materials for practical learning. There are no deadlines, pressure or any compulsion, but activities keep them engaged and enhance their overall learning ability.
