                <p>The main advantage of project based learning is that it promotes problem-solving 
                  skills in real-world context. 
                    Project-based learning (PBL) is considered an alternative to the teacher-led 
                    classroom model. In fact, this will integrate theory and practice. The benefits
                     are plenty including improved writing skill, understanding concepts, people and
                      processes in an organization. The center thought of PBL is that real-world 
                      problems capture students’ interest and provoke serious thinking, as the 
                      students acquire and apply new knowledge in a problem-solving context</p>
